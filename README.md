# twoSum
For this program, I created a class called makeSum and it contains two functions which is twoSum and the main. The twoSum function takes in an array of integers and a single integer called sum. First, the function contains a nested for loop and it cycles through the array of integers and cycles it again. If "i" in the first for loop plus the "j" in the second for loop equal the single integer "sum", and if they don't equal each other, it will report that i and j as an array. If there is no value in the array that is equal to the sum, the function will return {-1, -1}. In the main, I have two target integers which will be used a in the sum parameter in the twoSum function. I also have three unsorted arrays of integers. I then created an "indexes" variable that takes in an array of integers and it will equal to the function taking in the arrays and target integers. If the length of indexes = 2, it will print out the two indexes that add up to the target integer.
